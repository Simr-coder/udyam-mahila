  ## Made website design which helps women to upskill themselves
    --Mentorship is powerful tool for Women entrepreneurs grow. Women entrepreneurs essentially lacks mentorship and guidance, that's why in website there is section designed where they can seek personalized mentorship in their local languages. There are courses designed for them to learn and upskill themselves, there is also doubt session where they can ask their doubt or post their doubt in doubt section if the session time wasn't enough. To motivate women entrepreneurs and encourage active participation, there is ideas section where they can post their idea, Top 3 ideas will get Shout-Outs. These shout-outs recognize the top contributors â€” the women who provide the best business ideas. It's a great way to encourage friendly competition and foster an atmosphere of appreciation and recognition. There is also collaboration section designed where they can collaborate with their peers and make healthy community, this community will help them to stay motivate on their journey will all odds. Women entrepreneurs face lots of society discrimination and taunts by family, this community with women like them fighting and discussing other women entrepreneur's problems will encourage them to stay motivated in their journey. There is also motivational quotes carousel if they feel low sometimes.
